  about: |
    <p> <i>Fish Eating Fish</i> (FEF) is a multimedia installation that consists of three self-recorded testimonials, sculptures in wood and foam, photographs, hand-crafted seats, and an assortment of steel structures, speakers, and monitors. FEF was conceived after my earlier performance work, Cards Against Humanity, and builds upon the concept that one can manage trauma by following a particular path, specifically a path derived from the logic of the circular hand railing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As explained in the testimonials, this logic is that of a person who seeks relief from an acute emotional pain. The juxtaposition of the traumatic event and the logic's somewhat wild presumptions are meant to bring forth empathy, not solely for the person who is currently experiencing the loss but for all those faced with hardship.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <i>“It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it is then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs.” -Seneca</i> </p>
    <br>
    <p>FEF was an attempt to make a work that was purely earnest, not only through transparency and vulnerability, but also through a desire to help and share. Like Cards Against Humanity, the idea is intended to be circulated, through word-of-mouth, as in the testimonials, and through the intimacy of a postcard, of which hundreds were provided during the installation. The postcards depicted the image of the circular hand railing on one side and were left blank on the other.</p>

    "<i>Institute For Recurrent Progress</i> (IFRP), a collaborative project with the artist Ben     Nicholson, took place over four months inside Chicago’s Open House Contemporary."

    - "Shown with the bull were 4 pamphlets that laid out not only how to function inside the space but also what the Institute was and how to align with their will. To allow for guests to communicate with the Institute we constructed a keyboard terminal built into the same field of vision as the master bedrooms television. The terminal ran 24 hours and gave guests a direct line to the artists who posed as a naive but greedy organization bent on the sale and fostering of love for art. In the adjoining room a less grandiose second terminal was made and ran on the same timeline but linked viewers to a covert association that meant to obscure and thwart the immediacy of the arts understanding. Hidden around the apartment in redacted texts and ciphers this association was created to question the commerce of art and its seemingly indisputable cultural value."

  concept: In the wake of my fathers death I recieved a series of sympathy cards that inspired the described performance
  about: |
    Cards Against Humanity Cards is a short performance in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, describes the creation of a circular hand railing and the implementation of the ideas that the railing represents. The presentation displays a photograph of the circular hand railing (a wooden top supported by Spanish-style metal balusters) in front of whatever building in which the talk is taking place. It is important that the railing is not permanently installed in any one place but, rather, is staged and documented for the purpose of the talk.The photos that are used at the end of the performance are of hallmark cards that indicate that the speaker’s father has just passed away. The cards having generic depersonalized messages, are vessels of recognition alone. The cards represent not only the ease with which one can communicate condolence but also the ease with which a person might return to their everyday lives after such trauma (or so suggests the theory of the circular hand railing). By distancing oneself from the acute trauma and focusing instead on the possibilities and eventualities embedded in eternity, one can avoid experiencing pain. The performance and the installation that follows (Fish Eating Fish) are meant to ask: if we stoically avoid emotional pain what price will we pay?

  concept: I made 30 or so of these as I attempted to perfect the form. I love the people who own them. I'll keep trying when I work with glass again.
  about: |
    Uniform In 2007 I was still trying to figure out if I had talent, or at least if I had more talent than the others around me. So I focused on something that was hard for others to access and fairly uncomfortable to do. Through multiple bouts of dehydration and an internship with a really talented glass blower Kiara Pelissier I found out that nope I don’t have it. In the process I made about 6 of these 2 and a half foot vessels. Honestly, an image of one of them is included here because I’m still proud of them. They sit in the homes of people I love and from time to time when I’ve had too much wine i'll try and clean them against the will of their owners.
